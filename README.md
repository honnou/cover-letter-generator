# 📝 Cover Letter Generator

An intelligent tool that adapts your existing cover letter for new job opportunities. Simply provide an example cover letter and a new job description, and get a tailored cover letter instantly!

## ✨ Features

- **Multiple Input Formats**: Upload PDF, DOCX, or plain text files, or paste text directly
- **AI-Powered Adaptation**: Uses Claude (Anthropic) or GPT (OpenAI) to intelligently adapt your cover letter
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Download as TXT, DOCX, or PDF
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: User-friendly web interface with drag-and-drop support
- **No Data Storage**: All processing happens locally and in-memory
- **Works Offline**: Basic template generation works without AI API (AI recommended for best results)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ☁️ Option 1: Deploy to Cloud (Access from Anywhere!)

**Best option for mobile use and accessing from multiple devices!**

Deploy to Vercel's free tier for instant access from anywhere:

```bash
cd cover-letter-generator
npm install -g vercel  # Install Vercel CLI (one-time)
vercel                 # Deploy!
```

After deployment:
- You'll get a URL like `https://your-app.vercel.app`
- Access from **any device**, **anywhere**
- Add to your iPhone/Android home screen for app-like experience
- No computer needed after deployment!

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

### 💻 Option 2: Run Locally (Automatic Setup)

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
cd cover-letter-generator
./start.sh
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
cd cover-letter-generator
start.bat
```

The script will automatically:
1. Install all Python dependencies
2. Start the backend server
3. Open the web interface in your browser

### Option 3: Run Locally (Manual Setup)

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you encounter permission errors:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
   ```

2. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   python3 server.py
   ```

3. **Open the Web Interface:**
   - Open `index.html` in your browser
   - Or navigate to: `file:///path/to/cover-letter-generator/index.html`

## 🔑 AI Configuration (Recommended)

For best results, configure an AI API key:

### Using Anthropic Claude (Recommended)

1. Get an API key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

### Using OpenAI GPT

1. Get an API key at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Set the environment variables:
   ```bash
   export AI_PROVIDER='openai'
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

### Using .env File (Alternative)

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your API key:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

3. Restart the server

**Note:** The tool will work with basic template generation if no API key is provided, but AI-powered generation produces significantly better results.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Provide Your Example Cover Letter:**
   - Upload a file (PDF, DOCX, or TXT), OR
   - Paste your cover letter text directly

2. **Provide the New Job Description:**
   - Upload a file (PDF, DOCX, or TXT), OR
   - Paste the job description text directly

3. **Click "Generate Cover Letter"**
   - Wait a few seconds while the AI adapts your cover letter

4. **Review and Download:**
   - Review the generated cover letter
   - Download in your preferred format (TXT, DOCX, or PDF)
   - Edit as needed in your word processor

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **pip**: Python package manager
- **Browser**: Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Backend (server.py)
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Document Parsing**: PyPDF2, python-docx
- **Document Generation**: python-docx, ReportLab
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API, OpenAI API
- **Port**: 8080

### Frontend (index.html)
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- No frameworks required
- Responsive design
- Drag-and-drop file upload

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
```

### Server won't start
- Check if port 8080 is already in use
- Try killing existing Python processes:
  ```bash
  pkill -f server.py
  ```

### Browser doesn't open automatically
- Manually open `index.html` in your browser
- Or use VS Code's Live Server extension

### "Failed to connect to server" error
- Make sure the server is running on port 8080
- Check the server terminal for error messages
- Try restarting the server

### Generated cover letters are generic
- Configure an AI API key (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY)
- Without AI, the tool uses basic templates
- With AI, results are significantly better and more personalized

## 💡 Tips

- **Keep the server running** while generating multiple cover letters
- **Provide detailed job descriptions** for better results
- **Use a well-written example** as your template
- **Review and edit** the generated cover letter before sending
- **Customize further** in your preferred word processor
- Downloads are saved to your browser's download folder

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **No cloud storage**: All processing happens locally
- **No data retention**: Cover letters are not saved by the tool
- **API calls**: If using AI, data is sent to Anthropic/OpenAI APIs
- **Local files only**: Uploads are processed in memory and discarded

## 📝 Example Workflow

1. **Start the tool:**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

2. **Upload your best cover letter** from a previous application

3. **Paste the new job description** from the posting

4. **Click Generate** and wait ~5-10 seconds

5. **Review the result** - the AI adapts:
   - Your writing style and tone
   - Relevant skills and experiences
   - Company-specific customization
   - Industry-appropriate language

6. **Download as DOCX** and make final edits

7. **Submit with confidence!**
